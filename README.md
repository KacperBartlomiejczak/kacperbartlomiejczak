Hey there 💪  
I’m [Kacper](https://www.kacperbartlomiejczak.pl), a frontend developer from Poland.

I focus on building clean, fast and practical web apps that solve problems I run into as a student – task managers, study dashboards and small productivity tools.

**Stack:** Next.js · React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS  
**Daily tools:** VS Code · GitHub Copilot · Gemini CLI  
**Currently learning:** Angular

**Fun facts:**
- Coffee is basically my second bloodstream.
- I’d rather ship something imperfect than waste time doing nothing.
- “Suits” is my comfort series.
- I’m into anime, the gym and creating projects from scratch.
